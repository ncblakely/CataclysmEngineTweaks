[Engine]
; The new update rate to set. By default, the HW1/Cataclysm engine updates the universe 16 times per second.
; Due to many assumptions baked into the engine about the update rate being a power of 2, the new update rate must be one as well.
; Each increment increases the update rate by a factor of 2.
; Example:
; 0 - 16 FPS (default)
; 1 - 32 FPS
; 2 - 64 FPS
; 3 - 128 FPS (not recommended)
; Going above 2 is not recommended as it currently causes instability.
