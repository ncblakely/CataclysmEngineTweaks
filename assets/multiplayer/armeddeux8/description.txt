Description         Soban-re, learn this well. Battles cannot always be fought at a distance. Eventually you will have to fight an enemy at close quarters. In space, as with hand-to-hand combat, there are certain skills you must develop in order to survive. Chief among them is that you should always know where your opponent's striking limbs are at all times.
