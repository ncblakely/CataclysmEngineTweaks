strR1TECH_ADRIVE_FRIGATEinfo                                    UPGRADE FOR MULTI-BEAM FRIGATES (SU12) AND HIVE FRIGATES (SU20).\n\nINCREASES FRIGATE SPEED.\n\nONCE UPGRADED, THESE SHIPS WILL BENEFIT FROM AN INCREASE IN OVERALL ENGINE EFFICIENCY AND SPEED.
strR1TECH_DRIVE_DESTROYERinfo                                   REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CARRIERS (SU-) AND DESTROYERS (SU38).\n\nLEADS TO ADVANCED DESTROYER DRIVE TECHNOLOGY\n\nSTANDARD DRIVE FOR SUPER CAPITAL SHIPS.\n\nBASED ON DESTROYER DRIVES SALVAGED FROM RUINED IMPERIAL TAIIDAN VESSELS.
strR1TECH_ADRIVE_DESTROYERinfo                                  UPGRADE FOR CARRIERS (SU-) AND DESTROYERS (SU38).\n\nREQUIRED FOR DREADNOUGHTS (SU80).\n\nINCREASES CAPITAL SHIP SPEED.\n\nONCE UPGRADED THESE, SHIPS WILL BENEFIT FROM AN INCREASE IN OVERALL ENGINE EFFICIENCY AND SPEED.
strR1TECH_ARMOUR2info                                           UPGRADE FOR ALL FLEET SHIPS.\n\nLEADS TO TYPE 3 ARMOR TECHNOLOGY\n\nINCREASES DAMAGE RESISTANCE TO EXPLOSIVES.\n\nTYPE 2 ARMOR IS A LAYER OF THICK CRYSTAL POLYMER COMPOSITE INTERWOVEN WITH DEPLETED URANIUM AND IS CAPABLE OF FLEXING UNDER RADICAL IMPACTS. THE EFFECTIVE DAMAGE CAUSED BY MISSILES, KAMIKAZE ATTACKS, OR THE CRITICAL FAILURE OF NEARBY SHIPS IS GREATLY REDUCED. 
strR1TECH_ARMOUR3info                                           UPGRADE FOR SENTINELS (SU3), WORKERS (SU4), ALL CAPITAL SHIPS, AND THE COMMAND SHIP.\n\nINCREASES DAMAGE RESISTANCE TO ENERGY WEAPONS.\n\nTYPE 3 ARMOR PROVIDES TWO-FOLD PROTECTION AGAINST ENERGY WEAPONS, SUCH AS PLASMA BOMBS, ENERGY CANNONS, AND ION CANNONS. TYPE 3 ARMOR USES AN ABLATIVE LAYER AND A REFLECTIVE, SUPERCONDUCTIVE LAYER TO DEFLECT OR DISSIPATE AN ENERGY WEAPON.
strR1TECH_SUPPORT_SYSTEMSinfo                                   REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CARRIERS (SU-).\n\nINCREASES MAXIMUM FLEET SIZE.\n\nAN EFFECTIVE FLEET IS LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF LOGISTICAL SUPPORT IT HAS. WITHOUT ENOUGH GROUND CREW OR COMMAND SUPPORT, A FLEET CANNOT GROW. BUILDING MORE SUPPORT MODULES ON YOUR COMMAND SHIP OR CARRIERS WILL ALLOW FOR A LARGER ARMADA.
strR1TECH_MICRO_SHIPinfo                                        REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIVE FRIGATES (SU20), SENTINELS (SU3), AND LEECHES (SU2)\n\nSTANDARD DRIVE FOR MICRO CLASS SHIPS.\n\nONCE RESEARCH IS COMPLETED, NEW HIVE FRIGATES CAN BE CONSTRUCTED WITH A SWARMER CONTROL SYSTEM, 6 SWARMERS, AND A SMALL MAINTAINENCE CREW TO REPAIR DAMAGED SWARMERS OR BUILD NEW ONES IN THE FIELD.
strR1TECH_ENERGYinfo                                            REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF DREADNOUGHTS (SU80).\n\nUPGRADE FOR ALL FLEET SHIPS ARMED WITH MASS DRIVER CANNONS.\n\nREPLACES PROJECTILE WEAPONS WITH ENERGY CANNONS.\n\nDERIVED FROM RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE FIRING SPEED OF A PLASMA BOMB LAUNCHER. ENERGY CANNONS DRAW HIGH-ENERGY PLASMA FROM A SHIP DRIVE INTO A SMALL CONTAINMENT SPHERE. THESE CONTAINMENT SPHERES ARE REINFORCED TO WITHSTAND THE FAST-CYCLING FIRING SYSTEM.
strR1TECH_IONinfo                                               REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF MULTI-BEAM FRIGATES (SU12), DESTROYERS (SU38), AND DREADNOUGHTS (SU80).\n\nUNLIKE MASS-DRIVERS OR ENERGY CANNONS, ION CANNONS FIRE A STRONGER, CONSTANT BEAM OF ENERGY. ALTHOUGH DURATION OF FIRE TIME IS LIMITED DUE TO HEAT ISSUES, ION CANNONS MAKE UP FOR IT WITH THE HIGH DAMAGE INFLICTED DURING FIRE TIME.
strR1TECH_MISSILEinfo                                           REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF DREADNOUGHTS (SU80) AND DESTROYERS (SU38).\n\nMISSILES ARE A LONG RANGE WEAPON.\n\nDESPITE BEING AN OLD WEAPON DESIGN, MISSILES HAVE ENOUGH SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY TO BE A SERIOUS THREAT. MISSILE SYSTEMS HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FLEXIBLE WEAPONS PLATFORM WITH VARYING USES. MISSILES ARE EFFECTIVE AT BOTH SOFTENING UP ARMORED CAPITAL SHIPS AND TEARING UP SMALLER STRIKE CRAFT ATTACK WINGS.
strR1TECH_REPULSEinfo                                           UPGRADE FOR DREADNOUGHT.\n\nREPULSE WEAPON REPELS ENEMY SHIPS AWAY FROM DREADNOUGHT.\n\nGIVEN THE VASTNESS OF SPACE, SPACE COMBAT IS OFTEN PLAYED OUT AT CLOSE RANGE. FOR A MISSILE SHIP SUCH AS THE DREADNOUGHT, THIS IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FROM WHICH TO WORK. BY GENERATING A PULSE SIMILAR TO TWO MAGNETS REPELLING ONE ANOTHER (A GROSS SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SCIENCE INVOLVED), A DREADNOUGHT CAN PUT SPACE BETWEEN IT AND TARGET SHIPS.
strR1TECH_EMPinfo                                               UPGRADE FOR ACOLYTE COMPOSITE VEHICLES (SU4).\n\nEMP TEMPORARILY DISABLES ENEMY SHIPS.\n\nUSING THE COMBINED POWER PLANTS OF TWO ACOLYTES IN ACV MODE, AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE CAN BE BUILT AND DISCHARGED, DISABLING UNPROTECTED SHIPS. BY TRIGGERING IN TANDEM, A GROUP OF ACVs CAN AFFECT EVEN LARGE CAPITAL SHIPS (THOUGH NOT FOR VERY LONG). AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON, EMP IS BEST USED BY EXPERIENCED PILOTS FLYING ENERGY CANNON-UPGRADED ACVs.
strR1TECH_EXPLOSIVE_CHARGEinfo                                  UPGRADE FOR MIMIC COMPOSITE VEHICLES (SU2).\n\nINCREASES DAMAGE CAUSED BY KAMIKAZE ATTACKS.\n\nWHILE SEEMINGLY A COLD DECISION, MIMICS CAN BE OUTFITTED WITH A QUANTUM EXPLOSIVE PAYLOAD TO ENSURE MAXIMUM DAMAGE FROM A SUICIDE ATTACK. WHILE WE REGRET THE LOSS OF OUR KIITH BROTHERS, ENSURING THAT THEIR DEATHS AREN'T IN VAIN IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO FLEET COMMAND AND THE SOMTAAW-SA.
strR1TECH_LINKinfo                                              REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT ACVs (SU4), AND MCVs (SU4).\n\nALLOWS TWO ACOLYTES OR TWO MIMICS TO FORM A COMPOSITE VEHICLE.\n\nWHILE SIMPLE IN THEORY - LINK TWO SHIPS TOGETHER - DESIGNING A LINKING SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE AN EXTERNAL CREW AND CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY PILOTS IN THE FIELD IS QUITE COMPLEX.
strR1TECH_MIMICinfo                                             REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT MIMICS (SU3), AND MCVs (SU6).\n\nALLOWS MIMICS TO APPEAR AS OTHER SHIPS.\n\nA SINGLE MIMIC CAN PROJECT A FALSE IMAGE OF MOST SMALL SIZED SHIPS AND OBJECTS (FIGHTERS, MICRO-CLASS SHIPS, AND SMALL ASTEROIDS), BUT THE LINKED ARRAYS OF TWO MIMICS ARE REQUIRED TO PROJECT A FALSE IMAGE OF LARGER SHIPS.
strR1TECH_AFTERBURNERinfo                                       REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT HEAVY TUGS (RAMMING FRIGATES) (SU10) - MULTIPLAYER ONLY.\n\nALLOWS A HEAVY TUG TO PUSH OTHER SHIPS.\n\nWITH THE ADDITION OF AN AFTERBURN SYSTEM, A HEAVY TUG IS CAPABLE OF MOVING EVEN LARGE CAPITAL SHIPS AROUND. A "RAMMING FRIGATE" IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST MISSILE SHIPS BY MOVING THEM TOO FAR FROM THE MAIN BATTLE TO PROPERLY USE THEIR MISSILE OR REPULSE SYSTEMS.
strR1TECH_BIG_GUNinfo                                           UPGRADE FOR COMMAND SHIP.\n\nREQUIRED TO FIRE SIEGE CANNON.\n\nALLOWS COMMAND SHIP TO USE SIEGE CANNON.\n\nIF SUCCESSFULLY RESEARCHED THIS CLASS TWO (OFF-PLANET) SIEGE CANNON CAN BE AFFIXED TO THE SHIP AND FED POWER DIRECTLY FROM THE ENGINES (THROUGH A CUSTOM VENTING SYSTEM THROUGH THE UPPER, BACK SPINE). WHILE AN EXCELLENT LONG-RANGE WEAPON, A SIEGE CANNON IS A FRIENDLY-FIRE RISK TO ALL FLEET SHIPS WITHIN THE BLAST RADIUS.
strR1TECH_ADVANCED_SENSORSinfo                                  UPGRADE FOR RECONS AND SENTINELS (SU3).\n\nALLOWS SHIPS TO DETECT MIMICS, CLOAKED SHIPS, AND LEECHES (SU2).\n\nBY APPLYING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO RECONS AND SENTINELS, EACH SHIP WILL ENJOY AN INCREASE IN THEIR SENSOR RANGE, AS WELL AS ENABLE THEM TO DETECT SUPPRESSED SYSTEM SHIPS (MIMICKING, CLOAKING, AND LEECHES).
strR1TECH_FORCE_FIELD1info                                      UPGRADE FOR SENTINELS (SU3).\n\nLEADS TO LEVEL 2 ENERGY SHIELD TECHNOLOGY\n\nA LEVEL ONE FORCE FIELD IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP MASS DRIVER WEAPONS.
strR1TECH_FORCE_FIELD2info                                      UPGRADE FOR SENTINELS (SU3).\n\nLEADS TO LEVEL 3 ENERGY SHIELD TECHNOLOGY\n\nA LEVEL TWO FORCE FIELD IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP MISSILES.
strR1TECH_FORCE_FIELD3info                                      UPGRADE FOR SENTINELS (SU3).\n\nA LEVEL THREE FORCE FIELD IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP ENERGY BASED WEAPONS, SUCH AS ENERGY CANNONS AND ION CANNONS.
strR1TECH_INFECTinfo                                            REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND "INFECTION" PROCESS.\n\nSHIP SENSORS AND SECURITY CAMERAS, COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE FINAL DATA TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE CLEE-SAN WILL HOPEFULLY YIELD ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR SHIPS.
strR1TECH_REPAIRBOTSinfo                                        UPGRADE FOR FRIGATES, DESTROYER CLASS SHIPS, AND THE COMMAND SHIP.\n\nALLOWS SHIPS TO REPAIR THEMSELVES.\n\nWHEN UPGRADED, VESSELS CARRY AN ON-BOARD COMPLEMENT OF AUTONOMOUS REPAIR UNITS. THESE UNITS USE AN EXPERT SYSTEM SIMILAR TO A LEECH. THESE REPAIR UNITS ARE ESSENTIAL IF A UNIT IS GOING TO OPERATE A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE FROM A COMMAND SHIP OR A REPAIR-CAPABLE WORKER.
strR1TECH_CRYSTAL_HARVESTinfo                                   UPGRADE FOR WORKERS (SU4).\n\nALLOWS WORKERS TO HAUL DELICATE CRYSTAL FORMATIONS FOR PROCESSING.\n\nASTEROIDS WITH A DELICATE CRYSTAL LATTICE STRUCTURE ARE HIGHLY UNSTABLE, BUT INCREDIBLY RICH IN RESOURCES. A STANDARD WORKER PDA IS INCAPABLE OF HARVESTING A CRYSTAL. HOWEVER, WITH PROPER UPGRADING A WORKER CAN HAUL THE FRAGILE STRUCTURES TO A COMMAND SHIP FOR PROCESSING.
strR1TECH_RESEARCH_CLEESAN_ATTACKinfo                           REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE CLEE-SAN AND ITS ESCORT WING.\n\nWE HAVE LOST ALL CONTACT WITH THESE SHIPS AND MUST ASSUME THAT THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYED.\n\nFURTHER ANALYSIS OF ALL DATA IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM.
strR1TECH_BEAST_VACCINEinfo                                     UPGRADE FOR WORKERS (SU4).\n\nALLOWS SOMTAAW FLEETS TO SALVAGE BEAST SHIPS.\n\nIMPERIAL TAIIDAN RESEARCH HAS SURFACED THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING THE HANDLING AND STERILIZATION OF BEAST INFECTED SHIPS. THIS INFORMATION ALLOWS FOR THE SALVAGING OF BEAST INFECTED SOMTAAW SHIPS. GIVEN THE LACK OF INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROPERLY REPLACE AND REPAIR BEAST ALTERED SYSTEMS IN NON-SOMTAAW SHIPS, SALVAGING THEM IS POINTLESS.
strR1TECH_PHASED_TELEMETRYinfo                                  REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT LEECHES (SU2).\n\nALLOWS FOR ENCRYPTED CONTROL OF LEECHES.\n\nLEECHES ARE NOT ONLY ABLE TO AVOID DETECTION WITH THEIR SUPPRESSED AND SHIELDED ELECTRONICS (LEECHES ARE UNMANNED), BUT ALSO THROUGH A UNIQUE, REMOTE CONTROL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FLEET COMMAND TO SEND INSTRUCTIONS VIA BURST TACHYON TRANSMISSIONS. WITHOUT THESE A LEECH WOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF EVEN SIMPLE PROXIMITY NETWORKS.
strR1TECH_INERTIALESS_DRIVEinfo					    REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE NAGGAROK'S DRIVE TECHNOLOGY.\n\nTHE NAGGAROK IS MOVING FAR FASTER THAN A SHIP EVEN A TENTH OF ITS SIZE SHOULD BE ABLE TO.\n\nWE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY OF SHUTTING THIS DRIVE SYSTEM DOWN.\n\nONLY THEN WILL WE HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST IT IN COMBAT.
